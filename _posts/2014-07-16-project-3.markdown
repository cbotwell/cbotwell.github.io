description: This project is a responsive photography portfolio. I was tasked with recreating an example from a <a href="https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/raw/master/2.3-photo-site/2.png">static screenshot of the original</a>, but given the creative freedom to have some fun with it. Make sure to check out the hamburger menu on mobile.
